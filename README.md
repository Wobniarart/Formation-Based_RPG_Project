# Formation-Based_RPG_Project
For an RPG Project made in Unity
The Plan is to have a formation mechanic in the battle system which divides the battlefield into 20 tiles,
10 for each side (Player and enemy) and then have the characters positioned on this sort of board
In a similar fashion to an SRPG (like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, SMT Devil Survivor, etc..).
The game will be displayed from an isometric point of view using 2D sprites/Pixel art for characters.
The environemnts will be in 3D, the isometric perspective will just be a done through the camera angle in the Unity Editor.
